# NSAA-Express-Passport
> Project for Cybersecurity master. Subject NSAA. Project goal is to use Express and PassportJS to authenticate a user through JWT.
 ### Requirements
> This application has been tested with:
> - Node v12.16.2
> - Npm v7.7.5
> - MongoDB v4.4

All you need to run this applications is install modules with npm install and then node index.js.

This application has different endpoints:

- /login 
- /register
- /logout
- / 

To acces the fortune teller which is under /, you need to be authenticated. This has been done with JWT and PassportJs, the token is stored through cookies.

If you are not authenticated in the application you will not be able to access the fortune teller.

### Notes: 
- *To logout from the application you have to access to the endpoint directly, there is no button in the fortune teller view to logout.* [http://localhost:3000/logout](http://localhost:3000/logout)

- *There is no error handling on DB since it is not the goal of the subject, so things such as duplicated users messages can happen and message will be displayed directly in the page.*

- *There is also no styles on the web app since it is not yhe goal of the subject either, so everything is in plain html.*

- *Mongodb is autogenerated on first launch so there is no need to manually create anything.*

- *Passwords are generated with bycrypt library and also salt has been used to those passwords.*
